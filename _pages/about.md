<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Iâ€™m a Ph.D. student in SIGMA Lab from the Faculty of Information Science and Engineering, Ocean University of China, supervised by Professor <a href='https://yuyanwei.github.io/index.html'>Yanwei Yu.

My research focuses on AI for Data Preparation (AI4DP), with particular emphasis on designing deep learning algorithms and systems to support and automate the data preparation process. Data preparationâ€”the transformation of raw, large-scale data into high-quality, usable dataâ€”is a foundational step in data science and machine learning. It is widely recognized that data scientists typically devote over 80% of their time to this task. In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in leveraging deep learning techniques to address the challenges of data preparation.

My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wM8rqfwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wM8rqfwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
